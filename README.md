Since the Programmer, during testing, nor the User, during testing, can control the content, by design, no one can claim losses under any type of tort law or action. You agree that this means that someone else can post "production" material on a "test" system without the ability for the Operator to control. This, of course, has no effect on enforcement of laws by appropriate officials but does cover losses and tort.
